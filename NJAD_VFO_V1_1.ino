 *	"NJAD_VFO_V1.1.ino"
 *
 *	It's not just another digital VFO! This program is a heavily modified version of the
 *	digital VFO originally developed by: T.Uebo (JF3HZB) in February 2019.
 *
 *	The modifications were done by John Price (WA2FZW), Glenn Percy (VK3PA) and Jim 
 *	Smith (G3ZQC). Many features were added which makes this not only a digital VFO,
 *	but a fairly complete controller for ancient or new home-brew radios. The additional
 *	features include:
 *
 *		Multiband capability
 *		Allow a PCF8574 chip to read a band switch.
 *		Allow use of a second PCF8574 chip to read a mode switch
 *		Allow use of a display size of up to 240x320 pixels.
 *		Replaced the original rotary encoder and replaced it with a standard library.
 *		Added the ability to use very high speed encoders.
 *		Addition of a clarifier.
 *		Added the ability to read the TX/RX status of the radio.
 *		Added CAT control.
 *		Added the ability for the software to key the transmitter.
 *		Added 2nd VFO and all the stuff that goes with that capability.
 *		Added a “function button” which allows the dual VFOs to be manipulated manually.
 *		Added an optional battery monitor function.
 *		Added abutton to cycle through frequency change increments of 10Hz, 100Hz and 1KHz.
 *		Modify the carrier oscillator to use only CLK0 or only CLK1 or both in quadrature mode.
 *
 *	The hardware and software is fully described in the associated documents:
 *
 *		ESP32 VFO Hardware Manual (V1.1)		How to build it
 *		ESP32 VFO Hacker's Guide (V1.1)			How to program all the options
 *		ESP32 VFO CAT Control Manual (V1.1)		How to use the CAT control

/*
 *	Summary of the TTGO GPIO pins used (actual definitions are in "config.h"). Note, that for
 *	testing purposes, I have both the band switch and mode switch pins assigned to the same
 *	numbers, thus if one is implemented using GPIO pins, the other must use the PCF8574.
 *
 *	See the documentation for an explanation of the pin options when the PCF8574A is
 *	or isn't used.
 *
 *		GPIO Pin	Connects to
 *
 *			 2		Display DC
 *			 4		Transceiver PTT line (LOW indicates transmitting)
 *			 5		Display - CS (VSPI Bus)
 *			12		For CAT control - Keys the transmitter
 *			13		Frequency Encoder – B
 *			15		Frequency Encoder - A
 *			18		Display - SCLK (VSPI Bus)
 *			19		Reserved - Display MISO (VSPI bus - for reads)
 *			21		PCF8572 - SDA (Standard I2C bus)
 *			22		PCF8572 - SCL (Standard I2C bus)
 *			23		Display - MOSI/SDO (VSPI Bus)
 *			25		Clarifier Switch
 *			26		Si5351 - SDA (Alternate I2C bus)
 *			27		Si5351 - SCL (Alternate I2C bus)
 *			32		Clarifier Encoder - A (or optional Potentiometer Clarifier)
 *			33		Clarifier Encoder - B
 *			35		Battery voltage pin
 *			36		Mode select button
 *			39		Function Button
 *
 *
 *	Si5351 outputs:
 *
 *		CLK0		Carrier oscillator signal (I)
 *		CLK1		Carrier oscillator signal (Q)
 *		CLK2		VFO output (ala local oscillator)
 *
 *
 * Modifications in Version 1.1:
 *
 *		Changed all the "#include <arduino.h>" statements to "#include <Arduino.h>"
 *		for those comppiling on Linux platforms.
 *
 *		Added the capability to change operating modes using a pushbutton in a manner
 *		like the "INCR_BUTTON". That is each time the button is operated, the mode will
 *		change to the next entry in the "modeData" array. The advantage of this approach
 *		is that it can be used in conjunction with CAT control whereas a rotary type
 *		switch operating through the PCF8574 cannot be used with CAT control.

 *		vfoDir		Plus or minus 1 indicates how the VFO frequency relates to actual frequency
 *		opMode		The subscript of the modeData array for the default mode for the band
 *
 *	There can be up to 255 entries in the list, but there must be at least one.
 *
 *	The "Calibrate_Si5351" program can be used to set the crystal frequency and save it in

 *
 *	The HF band definitions here are for Glenn's FT-7. In that radio, the actual VFO
 *	frequency decreases as the operating frequency increases, so this is a good
 *	example of how to set that up. The 6 meter entry is for my Swan-250C in which the
