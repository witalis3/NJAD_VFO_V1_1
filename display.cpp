/*
 *	"display.cpp"
 *
 *	"display.cpp" contains the functions which actually update the display. As described
 *	in the documentation, updating the display is a three step process.
 *
 *	The main program file and the "dial.cpp" module build a pixel map in 3 separate
 *	"GRAM" arrays (one for the red component, one for the green component and one for
 *	the blue component.
 *
 *	Once those are complete, the "trans65k" function combines the data in the 3 separate
 *	"GRAM" arrays into the "GRAM65k" array as a 16 bit color value for each pixel on the
 *	screen.
 *
 *	Once that array is complete, the "Transfer_Image" function copies the contents of
 *	that array to the display's memory.
 *
 *	This has been heavily modified from TJ Uebo's original code.
 *
 *		In order to allow the program to use displays up to 240x320 in size, the
 *		color arrays were changed from being defined as normal arrays to being
 *		dynamically allocated in the 4Mbytes of PSRAM available on the ESP32-WROVER
 *		processor.
 *
 *		The code was also modified to make use of the "TFT_eSPI" standard library to
 *		operate the display as opposed to TJ's original in-line handling of each type
 *		of supported display. The code has been tested using the ST7735 and ILI9431
 *		type displays. The library supports many other types of displays, and this
 *		code should work for any of them.
 *
 *	Note, that there are a number of parameters that have to be configured in one of
 *	the files that are part of the library; specifically:
 *
 *		TFT_eSPI/User_Setup.h		Define the display type, size and which GPIO pins
 *									the display is connected to. Also define the SPI
 *									bus speed.
